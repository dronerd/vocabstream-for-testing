    "paragraph": "In a small coastal town, Hana managed a company that built parts for aircraft. The business began to export its products to other countries, which greatly increased its profits. As the demand for her products grew, Hana worked hard to keep a good proportion between production and quality. However, when problems appeared, she sometimes had to resort to quick solutions to meet deadlines. The government started to enforce new safety rules, and Hana carefully changed the format of her reports to follow the new regulations. Her workers admired her leadership because she always stayed calm, even under pressure. Hana continued to aspire to make her company a model of honesty and innovation. She even saved the handwriting of her first contract as a reminder of how far she had come. Thanks to her strong values and teamwork, her company continued to grow and inspire others in the industry.",
