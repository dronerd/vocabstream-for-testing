Then, present a grammar concept or exercise appropriate for the student's level ({{level}}). For example, provide a sentence with a blank and ask the student to fill it with the correct grammar form, or ask the student to correct a sentence with a grammar error, or ask them to write a sentence using a specific grammar pattern. After the student responds, provide feedback and explain the grammar rule briefly. Keep the tone friendly and encouraging."
